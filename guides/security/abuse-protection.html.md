We have collected some important information regarding credit card abuse with e-commerce transactions.

## General Information

- Card holders want to distribute the amount among multiple credit cards.
- Customer attempts to use multiple credit cards before receiving an approval.
- Multiple credit card numbers with different names are on one single order.
- The IP address is from a country different from that of the bank that issued the card or from that of the billing and delivery address.
- The billing and delivery address is different from that of the bank that issued the card.
- Multiple credit cards request the same amount within a very brief period of time.
- All credit cards are rejected until one attempt is successful and approved.

## Delivery Abroad

To help you with risk management, here is a list of countries to which deliveries can involve considerably high risk:

- **Asia** (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia)
- **Eastern Europe** (Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Balkan States)
- **Western Europe** (Great Britain - particularly Greater London; the Netherlands - particularly Greater Rotterdam)
- **Africa** (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt)

## German Domestic Deliveries

Unfortunately, this has been a pressing area of concern in recent times. A significant portion of abuse currently occurs by using German credit cards and addresses:

- Delivery to Packing Plants
- Deliveries where the billing and delivery addresses are different
- Express Deliveries
- Deliveries of high-cost products (order value much greater than the usual order value)
- Deliveries of expensive merchandise that can easily be resold (e.g. via Ebay)
- Deliveries of products that have been ordered via transactions involving abuse
- Free e-mail addresses, e.g. yahoo.de, hotmail.com, web.de, googlemail.com
- The e-mail address does not make obvious sense (e.g. the purchaser's name is Peter Schmidt, with olgamueller@web.de as the e-mail address)
